Convert measured quantities to moles first, use the ratio, then convert to the requested mass, concentration or volume.", "A primary-standard titration typically uses a pipette for a fixed aliquot and a burette for titrant.

Permanent dipole–dipole forces act between polar molecules. Hydrogen bonding requires H bonded to N, O or F and attraction to a lone pair on N, O or F of another molecule."]}, {"heading": "Properties and explanations", "points": ["Ionic solids have high melting points because strong electrostatic attractions act in all directions; they conduct when molten or dissolved because ions can move, but not as solids because ions are fixed.", "Simple molecular substances often have low melting/boiling points because intermolecular forces are overcome, not covalent bonds within molecules. Giant covalent structures have many strong covalent bonds, requiring substantial energy to break.", "A substance with hydrogen bonding often has a higher boiling point than a similar-sized molecule without it. Compare the type and relative strength of intermolecular forces, not the strength of covalent bonds within each molecule."]}, {"heading": "Exam practice", "points": ["Question (3 marks): Explain why water has a higher boiling point than H₂S. Mark points: water molecules form hydrogen bonds; H₂S does not form comparable hydrogen bonds; more energy is needed to overcome water's intermolecular attractions.", "Question (2 marks): Explain why graphite conducts electricity.

Added H⁺ reacts with A⁻ to form HA; added OH⁻ reacts with HA to form A⁻ and water. This limits pH change. Buffer capacity is greater at higher total concentrations and is strongest near pH = pKa when acid/base forms are comparable."]}, {"heading": "Exam practice", "points": ["Question (3 marks): Explain how an ethanoic acid/ethanoate buffer resists added alkali. Mark points: OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH; forms CH₃COO⁻ and water; only a small fraction of the weak acid is consumed, so pH changes slightly.", "When mixing a strong acid with a strong base, use mole stoichiometry first to find excess H⁺ or OH⁻, then calculate concentration in the total volume, then pH or pOH.

At 298 K, ΔG = 40.0 − (298 × 0.150) = −4.7 kJ mol⁻¹, so it is feasible under these conditions.", "For ΔH > 0 and ΔS > 0, increasing T makes TΔS larger and can make ΔG negative above a threshold temperature T = ΔH/ΔS. Keep units consistent before dividing."]}, {"heading": "Exam practice", "points": ["Question (2 marks): Explain why a feasible reaction may be slow. Mark points: feasibility is determined by ΔG; rate depends on activation energy/collision frequency, so a large activation energy can make the reaction slow.", "Do not confuse ΔS_system with total entropy change of universe; Gibbs energy at constant temperature and pressure is the useful feasibility criterion used here."]}]},

Secondary alcohol → ketone. Tertiary alcohols resist oxidation under ordinary acidified dichromate conditions. Acidified potassium dichromate changes orange to green when reduced.", "Carbonyls react with HCN (with suitable catalyst) to form hydroxynitriles; reduction with NaBH₄ gives alcohols. Carboxylic acids react with alcohols under acid catalysis to form esters; hydrolysis reverses ester formation under acidic or alkaline conditions."]}, {"heading": "Exam practice", "points": ["Question (3 marks): Explain why bromoalkanes generally hydrolyse faster than chloroalkanes with the same carbon skeleton. Mark points: C–Br bond is weaker/longer than C–Cl; it breaks more readily; substitution rate is higher under comparable conditions.", "For synthesis questions, write a clear sequence of reagents and conditions over each arrow, state intermediate structures, and choose a route that preserves the required carbon skeleton.

The electrophile is generated by a reagent/catalyst system, the ring attacks the electrophile, then loss of H⁺ restores the delocalised π system.", "Typical reactions include nitration using concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid with controlled warming; halogenation using a halogen and a Lewis-acid catalyst; Friedel–Crafts alkylation/acylation where included in the course content. Phenol activates the ring and directs substitution to 2,4,6 positions because the oxygen lone pair interacts with the ring."]}, {"heading": "Comparison", "points": ["Benzene tends to undergo substitution rather than addition because addition would destroy the stabilising delocalised π system. Alkenes more readily undergo addition across a localised C=C bond.", "Phenol is more acidic than typical alcohols because the phenoxide ion is stabilised by delocalisation of negative charge into the aromatic ring.

    "Since the 2019 SI redefinition the mole is defined by fixing the Avogadro constant exactly at 6.02214076×10²³ mol⁻¹, not by the mass of ¹²C. A mole is therefore simply a fixed count of entities, and the molar mass of ¹²C is now 12 g mol⁻¹ only to about one part in 10⁹. A-level 'the number of atoms in 12 g of carbon-12' is the historical definition.",
    "Primary standards (anhydrous Na₂CO₃, potassium hydrogenphthalate, KIO₃) are pure, stable, non-hygroscopic and have a high Mr, so a weighing error is a tiny fraction of the sample. NaOH is not one: it absorbs CO₂ and water from the air, so its solution must be standardised against a primary standard before it is used to find anything else.",
    "Uncertainty at degree level: for independent random errors, percentage uncertainties in a product or quotient combine in quadrature, δc/c = √[(δV₁/V₁)² + (δV₂/V₂)² + …], rather than simply adding. A-level adds them linearly, which gives the worst case. Quadrature gives a smaller, more realistic figure and is what you would use in a university practical report.",

    "Indicator choice depends on the titration curve. An indicator changes colour over about pK(In) ± 1 and must change inside the vertical section of the curve. Strong acid with strong base: pH jumps roughly 3 to 11, so almost any indicator works. Weak acid with strong base: equivalence pH > 7, so phenolphthalein (about 8.3–10).

Capacity depends on the absolute amounts of buffer, not just the ratio. Blood is buffered by H₂CO₃/HCO₃⁻ (effective pKₐ = 6.1 including dissolved CO₂), so at pH 7.4 the ratio [HCO₃⁻] ÷ [CO₂] = 10 raised to the power 1.3, about 20:1.",

    "Step-growth (condensation) and chain-growth (addition) polymerisation have different kinetics. In chain growth, long polymer forms immediately and monomer is consumed gradually. In step growth, any two molecules can react, so high molar mass only appears at very high conversion. The Carothers equation gives the number-average degree of polymerisation Xₙ = 1 ÷ (1 − p), where p is the fraction of functional groups that have reacted: p = 0.99 gives Xₙ = 100 and p = 0.999 gives Xₙ = 1000. Exact 1:1 stoichiometry of the two functional groups is critical, which is why nylon-6,6 is made via a 1:1 'nylon salt'.",
    "Free-radical polymerisation has three stages: initiation (a peroxide or AIBN decomposes to radicals), propagation (a radical adds to the C=C of a monomer to generate a new radical, thousands of times), and termination (two radicals combine or disproportionate). Chain transfer, including back-biting in polyethylene, produces branches, giving low-density polyethylene with a lower melting temperature. Ziegler–Natta and metallocene catalysts give linear polymer and control tacticity: isotactic polypropylene (all methyls on the same side) is crystalline and strong; atactic is amorphous and soft.",
    "Real polymer samples are a mixture of chain lengths. Number-average molar mass Mₙ = Σnᵢmᵢ ÷ Σnᵢ and mass-average Mw = Σnᵢmᵢ² ÷ Σnᵢmᵢ; the dispersity Đ = Mw ÷ Mₙ ≥ 1 measures the breadth of the distribution (Đ = 1 for perfect uniformity, as for proteins). For two chains of 10 000 and one of 40 000, Mₙ = 20 000, Mw = 30 000 and Đ = 1.5. Gel permeation chromatography separates by hydrodynamic size and measures the distribution.",
    "Properties depend on structure. The glass transition temperature Tg is where amorphous regions change from rigid glass to rubbery; melting Tm applies to crystalline regions. Strong intermolecular forces and regular, stiff chains raise both: nylon-6,6 (hydrogen bonds between amide groups, Tm about 265 °C), Kevlar (rigid para-linked aromatic polyamide that aligns in liquid-crystalline solution when spun, giving very high tensile strength), versus polyethylene (only weak dispersion forces, Tm 110–135 °C). Plasticisers (small molecules) lower Tg in PVC, making it flexible.",
    "Thermoplastics soften on heating (linear or branched chains, no covalent crosslinks); thermosets (epoxy resins, Bakelite) are permanently crosslinked and char instead of melting. Elastomers (rubber) have light crosslinking: Goodyear's vulcanisation adds sulfur bridges to natural rubber so chains snap back after stretching; heavy crosslinking gives ebonite. Natural rubber is the cis polymer of 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene).",
    "Sustainability: most addition polymers (polyethylene, PVC) have a saturated C–C backbone resistant to hydrolysis and biodegradation. Condensation polymers with ester or amide links can be hydrolysed: PLA (poly(lactic acid), made from lactic acid, an ester polymer) is compostable under industrial conditions, and PET can be depolymerised chemically back to monomers (glycolysis or methanolysis) for closed-loop recycling. Burning waste polymers releases CO₂ and may release HCl from PVC or HCN from nylon and polyurethanes, so energy recovery needs flue-gas treatment."

Only a hemiacetal can reopen to give the free aldehyde that reduces Benedict's reagent: maltose and lactose are reducing sugars, sucrose is not because its glycosidic bond ties up both anomeric carbons.",

In cellulose the β(1→4) link flips each successive glucose by 180°, giving straight chains that hydrogen-bond sideways into microfibrils with tensile strength comparable to steel. Humans lack a cellulase, so cellulose is dietary fibre.",
    "Glycogen is a better fuel store than free glucose because osmotic pressure depends on the number of particles: thousands of glucose units in one glycogen molecule exert the osmotic effect of one particle, so the store does not draw water into the cell. Branching also lets many phosphorylase enzymes work at once, which is why muscle can mobilise glucose in seconds. Plants use starch and animals use glycogen for the same reason: compact, insoluble, osmotically inert and quickly accessible.",
    "Lipids store more energy per gram (about 37 kJ g⁻¹ against about 17 kJ g⁻¹ for carbohydrate) because their carbon atoms are more reduced (more C–H bonds, fewer C–O), so more energy is released on oxidation; storage as anhydrous fat also avoids the 2–3 g of bound water per gram of glycogen. Triglycerides are formed from glycerol and three fatty acids by ester bonds (condensation); the degree of saturation controls the melting point: stearic acid (18:0) melts at about 69 °C, oleic acid (18:1 cis) at about 13 °C, and trans-elaidic acid at about 45 °C.",
    "A cis double bond puts a kink in the hydrocarbon tail, which stops tails from packing closely and therefore lowers the melting point and keeps membranes fluid; trans fats are straight, pack like saturated fat and raise LDL cholesterol.

Omega-3 fatty acids (double bond at the third carbon from the methyl end) cannot be made by humans and are essential.",
    "Phospholipids are amphipathic, so they spontaneously assemble in water. Above a critical micelle concentration (CMC) single-chain amphiphiles form micelles; double-tailed phospholipids, whose cone shape suits a flat sheet, form bilayers that close into vesicles. Assembly is driven by entropy: ordered water cages around hydrophobic tails are released when the tails cluster (the hydrophobic effect), not by a strong attraction between tails. This self-assembly is the basis of cell membranes, liposome drug delivery and soap cleaning.",
    "Cholesterol is a rigid, mostly hydrophobic molecule that inserts between phospholipids with its small –OH towards the head groups. It acts as a fluidity buffer: at high temperature it restricts movement of phospholipid tails and reduces fluidity; at low temperature it stops tails packing tightly and prevents the membrane freezing. It also reduces permeability to small polar molecules. Cholesterol is the precursor of steroid hormones, bile salts and vitamin D; atherosclerosis is linked to LDL-bound cholesterol being taken up by macrophages in artery walls."

Vmax = kcat[E]total, where kcat (the turnover number) is the number of substrate molecules converted per active site per second, from about 1 s⁻¹ for lysozyme to about 10⁷ s⁻¹ for catalase. Catalytic efficiency is kcat ÷ Km; the best enzymes approach the diffusion limit of 10⁸–10⁹ mol⁻¹ dm³ s⁻¹.",

Serine proteases (chymotrypsin) use a Ser–His–Asp catalytic triad. Rate enhancements reach 10¹⁷ (orotidine decarboxylase) over the uncatalysed reaction. The optimum pH reflects the ionisation of these key groups, and the temperature optimum is a balance between rate rising and denaturation.",

The net stability of a folded protein is small, only about 20–60 kJ mol⁻¹, a delicate balance of large opposing terms. Chaperones (Hsp70, GroEL) prevent misfolding and aggregation.",

Kinesin walks in 8 nm steps using one ATP per step. Colchicine and the anticancer drug paclitaxel (Taxol) target microtubule dynamics and so block mitosis.",

Chargaff's rules (A = T, G = C) were explained by base pairing: A–T has two hydrogen bonds, G–C three, so GC-rich DNA is more stable and has a higher melting temperature. DNA absorbs UV at 260 nm (A₂₆₀ of 1.0 ≈ 50 μg cm⁻³ of double-stranded DNA), and a ratio A₂₆₀/A₂₈₀ of about 1.8 indicates purity.",
    "Semi-conservative replication was proved by Meselson and Stahl (1958): E. coli grown in ¹⁵N medium was shifted to ¹⁴N and DNA was separated by density in a caesium chloride gradient. After one generation all DNA was of intermediate (hybrid) density, and after two generations half was hybrid and half light, ruling out conservative and dispersive models. Replication starts at origins; helicase unwinds, single-strand binding proteins stabilise, topoisomerase relieves supercoiling and primase makes an RNA primer.",
    "DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to a 3′ –OH, so it synthesises 5′ → 3′ only. The leading strand is made continuously, the lagging strand discontinuously as Okazaki fragments (about 1000–2000 nucleotides in bacteria, 100–200 in eukaryotes), joined by DNA ligase after primers are replaced. Accuracy is very high: the polymerase's base selection has an error rate of about 10⁻⁵, 3′ → 5′ proofreading exonuclease activity reduces it to about 10⁻⁷, and mismatch repair gives a final error rate of about 10⁻⁹–10⁻¹⁰ per base pair.",
    "Scale: the E. coli chromosome (4.6 million base pairs) is about 1.6 mm long but fits in a cell about 2 μm long, so DNA is packed by supercoiling. A haploid human genome (3.2×10⁹ base pairs) is about 1.1 m of DNA, about 2.2 m per diploid nucleus, compacted by winding around histone octamers into nucleosomes (about 147 base pairs per nucleosome, the 'beads on a string'), then into higher-order chromatin. Eukaryotic genes also contain introns that are spliced out and regulatory sequences far from the coding region.",
    "In translation, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases attach the correct amino acid to each tRNA (the second 'genetic code', with extremely high accuracy). The code is degenerate (64 codons, 20 amino acids) because wobble at the third codon position lets one tRNA read more than one codon. The ribosome's peptidyl transferase activity is carried out by rRNA, not protein, making the ribosome a ribozyme and supporting the 'RNA world' hypothesis. Reverse transcriptase (retroviruses, telomerase) makes DNA from an RNA template, which is why the central dogma is a rule of normal flow, not an absolute law.",
    "Mutations: substitutions may be silent (synonymous codon), missense (changes an amino acid) or nonsense (stop codon); insertions or deletions that are not multiples of three cause frameshifts that usually destroy the protein. Transitions (purine ↔ purine) are more common than transversions. Spontaneous deamination of cytosine to uracil is repaired because DNA normally has no uracil, which is probably why DNA uses thymine (methylated uracil): a deaminated 5-methylcytosine becomes thymine and cannot be recognised as damage, making methylated CpG sites mutation hotspots."

The sodium gradient it creates is then used for secondary active transport: the SGLT1 symporter in the gut moves glucose against its gradient together with 2 Na⁺ down theirs (the principle behind oral rehydration therapy), and SGLT2 reabsorbs glucose in the kidney, the target of the drug class of SGLT2 inhibitors.",

Birds use a cross-current system with unidirectional air flow through the lungs (via air sacs), the reason geese can fly over the Himalayas where oxygen partial pressure is low.",
    "Alveoli are prone to collapse because pressure inside a bubble is P = 2T ÷ r (Laplace's law): the smaller the radius, the higher the pressure that surface tension generates, so small alveoli would empty into larger ones.

Abscisic acid (ABA), produced in drought, triggers Ca²⁺ signalling that opens anion channels, so K⁺ and water leave and the pore closes within minutes.",
    "Pressure-flow (Münch) hypothesis for translocation: sucrose is loaded into sieve tubes at the source (via companion cells, using an H⁺/sucrose symporter powered by proton gradients, which is active loading), lowering Ψ so water enters from the xylem, raising turgor pressure (about 1–2 MPa); at the sink sucrose is removed, water leaves, and pressure falls, so mass flow moves sap down the pressure gradient at about 0.5–1 m h⁻¹.

Mycorrhizal fungi greatly extend uptake of phosphate and water.",

Full activation needs a second co-stimulatory signal; without it the T cell becomes anergic, preventing autoimmunity.

Hox genes controlling body plans are conserved across animals.

Water-soluble hormones (peptides, adrenaline) bind cell-surface receptors and act through second messengers within seconds. Affinity is described by the dissociation constant Kd: the hormone concentration at which half of the receptors are occupied.",

The signal is switched off by phosphodiesterase (breaks cAMP down; caffeine inhibits it) and by receptor desensitisation (β-arrestin).",

Type 2 diabetes is characterised by insulin resistance (cells respond less) and eventually β-cell failure; type 1 is autoimmune destruction of β-cells.",

The hypothalamic–pituitary axes (e.g. TRH → TSH → thyroxine) use long-loop negative feedback; positive feedback (oxytocin in labour, LH surge before ovulation) drives events to completion.
